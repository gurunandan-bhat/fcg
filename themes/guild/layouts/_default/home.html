          Berlin: The Spy Drama Isn't A Run-Of-The-Mill Espionage Thriler

          The film deserves kudos for its refusal to kowtow to the current
          demands of the Bollywood spy movie template
        </p>
        <p>
          New Delhi: Secret agents have been Bollywood action movie staples for
          some years now. A handful of them played by Mumbai's biggest stars now
          constitute a full-fledged spy universe rustled up by the industry's
          leading production house. They are unlikely to disappear from the
          Hindi showbiz radar anytime soon. Should we be interested in a small,
          understated cinematic clone built around a bunch of spies who are no
          patch on the big boys of the game? The answer is yes. Berlin, written
          and directed by Atul Sabharwal, isn't a run-of-the-mill espionage
          drama.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not a stirring affair by any stretch of the imagination but a sobering
          cautionary tale of sorts, the film subverts the genre. If you warm up
          to it, you might find enough in here to keep you invested.

          KishKindha Kaandam: A flawless screenplay drives this intriguing

          The true sign of any timeless work of art is that hard-to-achieve
          space of uncertainty, which the film masterfully occupies and easily
          finds a place among one of the best mystery-dramas Malayalam cinema
          has ever produced
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Layered’ is a term we throw around lazily to describe any screenplay
          that has just a little more depth than meets the eye. But where does
          one start, when describing a screenplay which gives of the impression
          of peeling an onion, layer by layer, only for us to end up with an
          orange? Do we start off with the sheer joy of marvelling at the
          ingenuity of the writing or about the pains of its three principal
          characters that slowly seep into us, and stay with us long after?
        </p>
        <p>
          KishKindha Kaandam, directed by Dinjith Ayyathan, is marked by a
          steady flow of events, almost none of which take the familiar route.
          It all begins from a routine government order ahead of elections for
          firearms licence holders to deposit their weapons at the nearest
          police station.

          Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier's standoff tale between a Black man
          and an entire corrupt town is nail-bitingly good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeremy Saulnier's Rebel Ridge doesn't waste a second getting into the
          thick of it. The Netflix feature opens with the incident that sets up
          the story. A Black man Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) is riding on a
          bike with headphones when he is abruptly thrown to the ground. Wrongly
          accused of carrying drug money, the former army man is on his way to
          bail out his cousin. The altercation goes off the wrong foot, setting
          the tone for the honourable man to give back to the crooked cops who
          have gamed the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Shelby Springs cops on patrol take advantage of Terry, they don't
          realise that they've managed to push the wrong guy to the brink. They
          'legally' seize his money and put up barriers that won't allow him to
          save his cousin from jail.

          Call Me Bae: A poor little rich woman’s coming of age is skin-deep

          Collin D’Cunha’s comedy, led by Ananya Panday, is out on Prime Video.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Prime Video series Call Me Bae, Ananya Panday plays Bella
          Chowdhary, a South Delhi heiress. Bae’s life capsizes when her
          high-profile marriage to Agastya (Vihaan Samat) ends badly after she’s
          caught canoodling with her personal trainer Prince (Varun Sood).
        </p>
        <p>
          A disgraced Bae is dumped by her BFFs as well as ejected from family
          chats, WhatsApp groups and Delhi itself. Like Caroline Channing in the
          American sitcom Two Broke Girls, Bae finds herself with cancelled
          credit cards. She has to leave home with only her designer wardrobe
          and her Gram-fam as her support.
        </p>
        <p>
          A penniless Bae moves to Mumbai, where she befriends Saira (Muskkan
          Jaferi), a trainee at a hotel. The unskilled Bae’s attempts at getting
          jobs are unsuccessful until a viral video of her shaming top-rated
          news anchor Satyajit Sen lands her an internship at the same channel.
