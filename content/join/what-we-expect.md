- Members shall declare any conflict of interest (e.g., working with members of the film fraternity whose films one is reviewing, consulting on scripts, working as script consultants or script writers, receiving payments for favourable reviews or social media posts, etc.) to the Managing Committee as soon as the commitment occurs. Managing committee will have the right to review and revoke membership status if there are more than two cases of non-disclosure. This may also be implemented retrospectively.
- Dormant Reviewers: Members are required to write to the FCG and inform of any change in employment status via email. This includes informing the FCG of current employment status, with supporting evidence of active reviewing work, or declare a change in professional circumstances. If after 6 months, a member is still not actively reviewing films, series or short films, they will be excused from the Film Critics Guild until their reviewing status is re-established. Members who fail to respond within this timeframe should be excused from the Guild until their active reviewing status is re-established.
- Members shall be personally liable for all acts and deeds.
- Members shall not plagiarise material, defined as deliberately copying the work of others and claiming it as your own, with no attribution.
- Members shall not steal goods or services from studio representatives, theatres or other Guild (FCG) members.
- The objectives of the Film Critics Guild (FCG) are of prime importance. Members must bear in mind these objectives and abide by the FCG Bye-Laws at all times.
- Members shall not use their Guild (FCG) membership to demand special treatment (this includes demanding promotional items for personal use, demanding extra screening passes or demanding free passes to films that have already opened)

- Members shall not falsify press credentials or professional associations.
- Members shall not falsely claim to be an official representative of the FCG.
- Members shall not engage in unauthorized recording of theatrical releases or post “live-tweet” or any social media reviews during a film screening. Films must be reviewed in their entirety. Strict action will be taken if this is brought to the attention of the managing committee. If a member is required to do this as part of their employment, then the Managing committee must be informed in writing and the member is expected to withdraw themselves from the FCG.
- All written reviews must be professionally edited and presented. Writers should check factual information for accuracy before printing or posting.
- Member shall not indulge in unauthorised copying and/or sale of studio screeners, including (but not limited to) internet distribution.
