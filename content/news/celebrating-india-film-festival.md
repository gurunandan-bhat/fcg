The Celebrating India Film Festival (CIFF) 2025 took place from August 8 to 10 at the NCUI Auditorium in New Delhi. The festival showcased films that explored India’s environment, heritage, art, culture and spirituality, with a focus on stories rooted in the country’s diverse identity. Organised by Graphisads, CIFF positioned itself as a platform for meaningful storytelling and thoughtful conversations in cinema, bringing together filmmakers, critics and audiences.

This year’s edition featured a Best of CCA 2025 short film package, showcasing work by emerging filmmakers. Six shorts were screened as part of the package, followed by a panel discussion on the art of film criticism, featuring Film Critics Guild members Anuj Kumar, Arnab Banerjee and Deepak Dua, who discussed contemporary perspectives and challenges in reviewing cinema.
