Canvasses Unmasked, held on August 15, 2025, was a standout event at **_Malhar_**, the annual intercollegiate cultural festival of St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai. Organized by the Entertainment Theatricals and Contests and Fine Arts departments, the event challenged teams to bring iconic portrait paintings to life through face painting, costumes, and a short theatrical performance.

The jury featured **_Priya Banerjee_** (actress, yogi), **_Rytasha Rathore_** (actress, theatre artist), and **_Rahul Desai_** (film critic and Film Critics Guild member). Canvasses Unmasked blended visual art and theatre, as teams transformed iconic portrait paintings into live performances using face paint, costumes, and props. The goal was to bring still images to life and give timeless art a new voice.
