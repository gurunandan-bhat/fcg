There are always visual and grammatical cues to determine the origin of any kind of cinema. In India, it differs with language and region but there is one kind of image that is not exactly the pride of Tamil cinema. Simplistic and overused in the last thirty years, its progenitor is probably director Shankar though the image draws power from the long history of Tamil Nadu in post-independent India.

It is the sight of protesting people, the sight of people pouring their emotions out to the TV media, news footage spilling over as a character on screen and people surrounding a terrible event or crime. They mean to add to the gravity of the situation. The severity of it all. It has appeared in many films and evolved to feature on the internet and social media. An indelible image from Tamil cinema, one that looks to quickfire solutions to sociopolitical issues, in which one man fights for the angry citizens populating these scenes. TJ Gnanavel uses these images in Vettaiyan, his third film, this one increasing the stakes by featuring Rajinikanth taking the law in his hands while also being responsible for its preservation.

There are many such scenes of disgruntled citizens and news footage in Vettaiyan. Gnanavel concerns himself with several issues at once, it is like walking into a multi-cuisine restaurant and not even a single dish is done well. There is the NEET exam recast as a generic coaching centre scam, caste and class prejudice, and most of all, extrajudicial killings popularly referred to as encounters. It is hard to believe that Gnanavel is a former journalist, we see TV news flashing the autopsy report after the rape and murder of a woman. Her name and images are everywhere and there is video too. Just because the murderer's identity is the initial mystery that moves the plot, he returns to the crime several times playing it through different angles. Maybe the film needs to take some liberty for the plot mechanics but is it impossible to tell a story about how extrajudicial killings are nothing but murder without involving the collective discontent and restlessness of a whole population? Does it take an innocent man’s murder to realise the mistake? Can’t the point be made at a purely ideological level? There seems to be a flaw in the approach even if the intentions seem noble.
