Shiboprosad Mukherjee and Nandita Roy’s Bohurupi delivers what it promises: unadulterated entertainment. It is fun watching this mad cat-and-mouse game. The film is lavishly shot, and most importantly, made with care. It excels in almost every department with Shiboprosad’s skillful acting hogging the lion’s share of the limelight.

To begin with, Bohurupi is based on a well-written script and made almost like a biopic of Bikram’s character. The comedy timing, the chemistry between the two lead pairs, the action sequences – everything seems to have worked suitably along with its script. There is no glaring social commentary and that has allowed the film to emerge as a champion masala entertainer. The second half gets into a bit of melodrama but recovers from it quickly.

The film has riveting chase sequences and police action. There is adequate and authentic violence without making it tiresome to watch. The care in the making is also reflected in its breathtakingly beautiful shots of rural Bengal. The gorgeous landscapes have established the big screen magic. The makers have used intimate scenes between the lead pairs with flowing water. Pori’s (Ritabhari Chakraborty) disturbed mind gets trapped in an imaginary mansion in the song, Aj Shara Bela. The theatrics of Bohurupi artistes are also nicely done.
