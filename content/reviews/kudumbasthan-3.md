Remember TVF breaking into the Hindi web series space during the OTT boom? While not on the similar scale, Nakkalites managed to do that in the Tamil space with their native, relatable, and well-performed sketches that boasted of decent production value, and strong content. Since all rivers in this part of the world have to flow into cinema, many actors from this setup managed to eke out a name for themselves on the big screen too. Now, its director Rajeshwar Kalisamy has come with Kudumbasthan, a film that reflects the ethos of Nakkalites, features actors from Nakkalites, has the same irreverent vibe of Nakkalites, and for what its worth, makes quite an impression. Kudumbasthan is a rather simplistic film that revolves around the life of Naveen (a terrific Manikandan). He is the typical average joe, and the ordinariness of his character makes things all the more interesting. When we are bombarded with stories of the extraordinary, the ordinary would turn special. He elopes and gets married to Vennila (a promising Saanve Meghana, who deserved better). Theirs is an inter-caste marriage, and Naveen’s family doesn’t miss a chance to insult the marriage and Vennila. Why does she still accept all of this and be with Naveen? Love. Why does he accept all this and not push for Vennila getting respect in the house? Because he is a kudumbasthan, and the ‘peace’ of the house is more important. Now, this would have been a major plot point in any other film, but Kudumbasthan focusses more on the fun factor, and keeps the emotional core at an arm’s length. For most parts of the movie, this approach works, but when we are suddenly asked to ‘connect’ with the protagonist, we are still at the same arm’s length.
