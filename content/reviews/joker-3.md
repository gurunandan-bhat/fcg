There is a moment early in Todd Philips' latest film Joker: Folie à Deux featuring the leads Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga that summarises the film well. It is the first courtroom scene in the film and Phoenix's Joker is desperately looking at the door waiting for Lee or Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) to walk into the court. Joker or Arthur Flec is on trial for killing six people including a popular chat show host live on television. While the tension in the room is palpable, Arthur keeps looking at the door. Lee enters and the two lovers exchange a smile. As Lee settles in, Arthur looks at her and pretends to stifle a yawn- referring to how boring the legal proceedings and the room is. The moment accurately captures the mood of the film.

Written by Philips and Scott Silver, Joker: Folie à Deux is a sequel to the 2019 film Joker. The American psychological musical drama has Joaquin Phoenix returning as the troubled DC villain Joker, a role that earned him an Oscar in 2019. Giving him company in part 2 is Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, a fellow inmate that Arthur meets at the asylum and who matches his crazy with her set of crazy.

The film starts from where Joker had ended. Arthur is lodged in a correction center/asylum in Gotham City after killing Murray Franklin live on television. While district attorney Harvey Dent is pushing for capital punishment for Arthur, his lawyer is keen to plea in court and ask for mercy considering his mental health.

Arthur, a quiet and feeble man is now more keen to live a life with Lee who wants to 'build a mountain' with him once he is freed. But the court proceedings are long and complex and Arthur often finds himself in a fix, having issues trusting what's being fed to him.
