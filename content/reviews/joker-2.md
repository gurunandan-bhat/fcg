One of the most anticipated releases of the year, Joker: Folie Ã  Deux is just hours away from its theatrical release in India. The film has been garnering a lot of attention and hype ever since the casting of the film was announced. While Joaquin Phoenix returns as Joker, Lady Gaga joins the Todd Philip film as Joker's love interest Harley Quinn.

The film is slated for an October 4 release worldwide and it is scheduled to release in India earlier on October 2. It has been making the rounds of a few film festivals and has already had a premiere in New York and London. Early reactions to the film appear to be mixed. While netizens seem to have loved the film and heaped praises on Gaga's performance in particular, critics have called the film 'dull' and stated that Gaga has been underused.
