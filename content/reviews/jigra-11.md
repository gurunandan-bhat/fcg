The clock’s ticking for Satya (Alia Bhatt) in Vasan Bala’s Jigra. Her brother Ankur (Vedang Raina) is on death row in an island nation called Hanshi Dao (a fictitious version of Singapore), and she’s just gotten news that the date of his execution has been expedited for an attempted jailbreak. What was supposed to happen in a few weeks, will now happen in a few days. We see her face computing all possible ploys as fast as she can, and then deciding on a plan of action. It’s not going to be pretty, an accomplice warns, but she’s already made up her mind.

The accomplice backs out, telling Satya that she’ll be on her own. “I never said I was a hero. I’ll understand if you don’t wish to join me,” she says, “but don’t get in my way.”

Vasan Bala’s films have often been rooted in their affection for pop culture, but his reinvention of Amitabh Bachchan’s ‘angry young man’ through a petite-looking Bhatt is among his biggest successes in his brief career. Bhatt plays Satya, a human form of a sledge hammer: lean, no wasted movement, striking with purpose.

She’s surrounded by burly-looking men with guns, experience, wisdom – but none of them have her focus, endurance, and courage (translating to Jigra) to make decisions that look impulsive, but always seem to pan out in the end. The wordplay in the title for Bala’s film also means ‘sweetheart’ – how Satya sees Ankur.

Orphaned at a young age, after they saw their father kill himself, Satya has been both a parent and an elder sibling to Ankur. They live with a distant relative in Delhi’s Maharani Bagh locality, where they’re constantly reminded of their identity as strangers in the house – especially in the formal manner that the relatives keep telling them they’re ‘part of the family’.
