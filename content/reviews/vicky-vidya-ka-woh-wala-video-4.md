Rajkummar Rao and Triptii Dimri’s latest release Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video is a social comedy that focuses on the length of the story more than logic. With a shorter, more crisp story the film would have managed to give the very serious and important message it wishes to. The film is a cautionary tale in the 1990s but the fear is very relevant and still prevalent given the growing use of AI, instead of finding a way to incorporate the fear throughout, the story focuses a bit too much on the comedy punch lines and hopes a long monologue will make up for the rest. But it doesn’t.

The film begins with Vicky and Vidya’s quirky wedding. Vicky is the biggest mehendi artist in the district and Vidya is an MBBS practitioner doctor. Their relationship and cast differences wouldn’t let them unite and they find a way around it by breaking her engagement publicly. Vicky then steps in as the righteous man to do the right thing for his neighbour and get married to Vidya, their original plan. While in written the scene is a cute introduction to their very common situation in the 90s, the film doesn’t do it justice.

If the first scene had done little to explore their relationship, then what comes next would have made more sense to the audience, to give into the dynamics of their relationship. To explain why Vidya would agree when Vicky asks if they should film their honeymoon night. The film for the rest of the run time of 152 minutes runs around the idea of finding the lost DVD, worrying that it will be old in the adult entertainment industry. We roam around the city, meeting goons and cops but end up with nothing until the last 10 minutes of the film.
