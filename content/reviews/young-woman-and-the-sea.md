Young Woman and the Sea is a typical sports drama, like the ones that were made often in Hollywood two to three decades ago. The period drama, directed by Joachim Rønning, follows the real-life story of Trudy Ederle, a young American who set some extraordinary records and inspired a whole generation of women after her.

Daisy Ridley, best known for her role in the newer Star Wars trilogy, takes on the physical role of the plucky swimmer who always wanted to push herself. With a compelling supporting cast, director Rønning and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson bring alive the tale of a forgotten woman in sporting history.

While the film is based on Glenn Stout's detailed book Young Woman and the Sea, it does dramatise and embellish certain facts for the sake of cinematic liberty, giving Trudy's journey more of an emotional heft. Young Woman and the Sea establishes the story of the Ederles, a German immigrant family in New York City. Trudy's mother Gertrude (Jeanette Hain) pushes her and her older sister Meg (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) to swim in time when most women were forbidden. Her father Henry (Kim Bodnia) is a butcher with old-fashioned ideas who initially doesn't support her goals.

Ridley portrays Trudy as a young woman with an unwavering zest to prove herself, first to her parents and later the global stage, as she aims to compete alongside men and become the first woman to swim across the English Channel. While she has a champion in her corner with swimming coach Charlotte (Sian Clifford), her sponsor (Glenn Fleshler) and trainer Jabez Wolffe (Christopher Eccleston) are more of a hindrance than help in her journey. Eventually, she gains support from her family and an unusual fellow swimmer Bill Burgess (Stephen Graham) to break the record.

Ridley and her winsome smile are the driving force behind this emotional feature. She translates Trudy's unwavering commitment to achieve her goal of swimming the Channel with triumph and humour. Clifford and Graham as Trudy's coaches and Fleshler and Bodnia as her parents turn in earnest performances. Meanwhile, Eccleston is almost unrecognisable but effective as Trudy's incompetent trainer.

Even before we meet Trudy, we know she's going the distance and proving all her naysayers wrong. Yet the director and writer duo of Rønning and Nathanson makes us forget it all as we journey alongside Trudy from her days as a nobody to becoming a state and world champion. They check all the right boxes as they reveal her story. Later, the feature shows the unfair treatment of the women swim team at the 1924 Paris Olympics as they are denied training and other facilities before the tournament. But despite all the odds stacked up against her, and even some family opposition, Trudy manages to persevere.

Like the Annette Bening starrer Nyad, this swimming-based feature is a story about resilience and the courage to follow through on a dream. Moreover, with the 100th anniversary of Trudy's achievements at the Olympics, it's a fitting story to remind audiences of how the restrictions that prevented women from equal rights in the sporting arena. More than a historical tale, Young Woman and the Sea is an empowering yet heartfelt feature about never giving up. The feature does get predictable at times, but you can't deny it has plenty of heart
