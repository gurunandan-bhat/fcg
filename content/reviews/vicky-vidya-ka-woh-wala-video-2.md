The promo promised entertainment around the missing CD of a video shot by a couple on its first night. Written and directed by Raaj Shaandilyaa, the promo stirred a strong pre-release buzz. The sense of fun does spill into the first few scenes as glib-talking mehndiwala Vicky (Rajkummar Rao) stages a scene at the engagement of his girlfriend Vidya (Triptii Dimri). It ends the way Vicky and Vidya had planned it with her lawyer-fiancé walking off in a huff and the man who applied mehndi at functions, stepping in to marry his girl.

Raaj gets it right at the first round by casting the hero in the rare character of a mehndiwala and sets the tone for humour with the fiancé (Manjot Singh) being called a “mini Sidhu” along with a few cracks at the “honhaar lawyer”. When the fiancé stomps off, swearing that he’ll marry even the naukrani but not Vidya, the house-help called Chanda steps forward hopefully.

The premise of a couple making a CD of its first night intimacy, a thief sneaking in and stealing several items including the CD that’s still in the recorder, and Vicky-Vidya running helter-skelter to retrieve the CD before it’s viewed publicly, is fertile ground for a lot of fun.

Some of the scenes like Vicky seeing CDs everywhere he turns, are comic. There are some chuckle-worthy lines too, like a man saying “Do sau do” as the room number and the cop interpreting it as “give me 200”. Vicky’s father (Tiku Talsania) thinking the CD features him and the maid and the mix-up that ensues also had some potential for humour. But the confusion created over the maid and Vicky’s sister who’s also called Chanda (Mallika Sherawat) seems forced especially in their scenes with the police inspector (Vijay Raaz). as the policeman with a severe piles problem.

Reliable Vijay Raaz, playing a cop with a severe piles problem, brings with him fleeting moments of mirth when he says something out of line and ends it with, “Some others may talk like that but not me.” Mallika too, cracks the same dialogue much later which lands well. But there are far too many sequences like ‘Tumhe apna banana ki kasam’ being picturised on Vijay Raaz and Mallika Sherawat which prolong the film without adding any entertainment.
