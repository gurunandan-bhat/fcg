Raat Jawaan Hai unfolds as an uncharacteristically warm and vibrant answer to a question popular Hindi cinema is too streamlined to ask: what happens after the end credits of the quintessential buddy comedy have rolled? Call it “Little Things for young parents” or “Dil Chahta Hai for reluctant adults”, but the fact that Raat Jawaan Hai fuses two seemingly exclusive genres of life — the friendship triangle and the marital drama — is, in itself, a minor triumph.

The eight-episode series revolves around three 30-something childhood friends struggling to reclaim their individualism in the throes of early parenthood. It trusts the inherent relatability of its theme, evoking the slice-of-life subgenre of Tu Hai Mera Sunday (2017) rather than the cosmetic excesses of Four More Shots Please! and Jee Karda (2023). The innuendo of the title (which translates to “the night is young”) is a nifty pun because it best embodies the spirit of adulting. With age comes the sobriety of realising that it actually means: “This is only the beginning”.

Avinash (Barun Sobti) is the chill one: a stay-at-home dad coping with his own subversions of masculinity and self-worth. Radhika (Anjali Anand) is the hot-headed one: a stay-at-home mom desperate to transcend the label of a “housewife”. Suman (Priya Bapat) is the timid one: a conservative homemaker grappling with issues of self-expression and intimacy. The one thing they share — apart from a formative bond and working spouses — is the deep-set exhaustion of being new parents. Their existence is determined by the suspense of a sleeping baby. Avinash and his wife Swadha (Hasleen Kaur) race against time and baby monitors to consummate their lust, but the result is a series of failed sexcapades. The only romance that Suman and husband Sattu (Vikram Singh Chauhan) can afford is a sweet touch-up — he adjusts his turban; she wears something nice — before he rings the doorbell every evening. Radhika and her husband Rishi (Priyansh Jora) resort to orgasmic head massages to reward each other for being thoughtful.
