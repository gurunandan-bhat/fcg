Three childhood friends and stay-at-home parents Avinash, Radhika and Suman come to terms with adulthood, marriage and parenting in a metropolis, dealing with one blow after the other. While Avinash is in no mood to return to work soon, Radhika is in two minds about taking up a job. Suman, content with motherhood, struggles to take a stance for herself.

Barun Sobti has consistently picked stories that have defied stereotypes and audience expectations around him – and Raat Jawaan Hai is no different. He’s comfortable in the shoes of Avinash, the stay-at-home dad. If Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani showed what Anjali Anand was capable of, this series further consolidates her position as a bankable performer, playing a modern-day mom.

Priya Bapat continues to have a great 2024 after two terrific outings – Visfot and Zindaginama. She makes a meal out of a superbly fleshed-out character here as well. Cast as the on-screen partners of the leads, Hasleen Kaur, Priyansh Jora and Vikram Singh Chauhan deliver the goods too.

Most portrayals of friendship in Hindi cinema over the years are restricted to good ol’ days of childhood and college years – almost making adult friendships seem impractical and impossible. While Raat Jawaan Hai is also about three childhood pals, it explores an interesting phase in their lives – the late 20s and the early 30s – where a trio tries to make their friendship work as adults and ‘young’ parents (of infants).

The gender mix – focusing on friendship among two women and a man – adds an element of intrigue to the setup. Yes, there’s a cliche to lend familiarity to their bond. There was a point when Suman had a crush on Avinash, but they outgrew it in no time. Many years later, at a phase when there’s too much drama in their lives, friendship is therapy and they find solace in each other’s company.

More than a plot, Raat Jawaan Hai brings together a few quirky episodes in their lives – as they hunt for a nanny, find some ‘me’ time to watch a film, free themselves from the guilt of abandoning their children, escape the eyes of prying in-laws, trying to be their good ol’ selves sans any baggage. As one of them rightly puts it, making time for themselves is almost like ‘running a space expedition.’
