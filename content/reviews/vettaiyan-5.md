Journalist-turned-director T. J. Gnanavel doesn’t seem to care much for any sort of filmmaking subtleties. It’s as though he enjoys dialling up the volume knob to underline his already-dramatic writing, and doesn’t let you rest until you feel the full weight of a scene’s emotions. This was obvious in the way he didn’t stop by just showing you a police officer dragging a beaten-up Manikandan K. into the back of a police jeep in Jai Bhim (2021).

He went a step further to then show a shot of a toy getting crushed under the jeep’s wheels to remind you that Manikandan was on his way to see his daughter and his newly-pregnant wife when this bit of police brutality took place.

Vettaiyan, too, operates on a similar pitch, maybe even louder, given the massier nature of its superstar’s fanbase. Not only are we pushed straight into a high-profile case involving drug-peddling bad guys in Kanyakumari, but we also get elaborate follow-ups involving pieces-to-camera to show you how society is reacting to each development. We get protests, TV debates, and a dozen reaction shots to make you feel the larger impact of the Superintendent of Police, Athiyan (Rajinikanth), and his trigger-happy police force.

Trigger-happy because he’s something of a legend among encounter specialists — a “hunter” known for wrapping up cases in 48 hours when the judicial system takes 48 years to deliver justice. But for a filmmaker whom we’re quick to dismiss as unsubtle, there’s a respectable amount of detail in the writing that makes this first hour very special for a typically violent Rajinikanth film.

This is obvious in the manner in which there’s a faint amount of self-awareness in the way we’re first introduced to SP Athiyan. It’s almost a mirror image of the way he was introduced in films like Darbar (2020), with a group of goons simply waiting for him to arrive to be beaten into submission. The staging is so flat and uninventive that you can hear T. J. Gnanavel telling his stunt choreographer to shoot the whole thing, and give Rajinikanth’s fans what he wants. It’s the same with the ‘Manasilayo’ song, the standard-issue Rajinikanth intro song featuring a little bit of dance and a lot of life advice. These portions are bland and ordinary, but you know the director of Jai Bhim is getting at something by finishing these market-stipulated distractions.
