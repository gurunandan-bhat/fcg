Vettaiyan brings together two cinematic legends—Rajinikanth as Athiyan, a top cop delivering swift justice, and Amitabh Bachchan as Justice Sathyadev Bramhadutt Pande, who questions the very foundation of that justice. Director TJ Gnanavel sets up a thought-provoking premise that wrestles with themes of morality, justice, and redemption, but unfortunately, the film struggles to deliver a compelling narrative.

At the heart of Vettaiyan is Athiyan, a law enforcer who is celebrated by the media and the public for his efficiency in "solving" cases. When he's tasked with eliminating a fugitive, he executes his mission within 48 hours, and society hails him as a hero. But the entry of Justice Sathyadev turns the narrative on its head. The justice's presence forces Athiyan to confront an unsettling truth: Did he really kill the right man?

This sets the stage for a potentially gripping character arc—Athiyan's fall from grace and his journey toward redemption. The film could have followed this hero’s transformation, similar to Kamal Haasan’s Hey Ram, where the protagonist undergoes a harrowing and deeply emotional journey before realizing his ideology was flawed. However, Gnanavel's execution feels rushed. Rather than allowing the audience to experience Athiyan’s transformation, we’re merely told about it through snippets of news reports. The lack of emotional depth leaves us detached from what could have been a powerful story.

The film is further bogged down by subplots and an overabundance of A-list actors who don’t contribute meaningfully to the story. Dushara Vijayan’s character Saranya, for example, is a predictable archetype of the good-hearted woman who meets a tragic fate. Manju Warrier’s talents are underutilized, and even Fahadh Faasil, though delivering some well-timed comedic moments, is given too little to work with.
